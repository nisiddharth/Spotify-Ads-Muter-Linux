# Spotify Ads muter for Linux

Uses dbus, applicable for systems using PulseAudio. Only works while using Spotify client (doesn't matter how you install it) and not web browser.

Mutes and unmutes Spotify within 5 seconds of start and end of Ads.

### Usage:

To use just run `mute_spotify_timer.sh` either using terminal or Alt + F2 launcher or just add it to list of system Startup Applications.

### Maintenance:

I'll make this more efficient when I'll feel free. Meanwhile you can send Pull Requests!
